       <p>
         In this module we learned about how to create our own website.
         Lanuages like HTML,CSS Aand JS are used in creating our webpages.
       </p>
       <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The firt step was to create the structure of website with the help of HTML,
                there are some basic tags like h1-h6,b,div and many more which are used in HTML.
                HTML helps us making the overall written works and all contains of the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second step is to join it with CSS. 
                HTML just shows the written work but without colours, and here comes the CSS.
                CSS hepls in making our website more attractive by modifying their colours and positioning.
                some of the attributes used in CSS are padding,gap,flex,colours and many more.
            </li>
            <li>
                The third step requires Javascript(JS).
                With the help of JS we can make our website userfriendly.
                By applying Javascript our website can performe functions within it (according to the instructions provided).         
            </li>
            <li>
                And the final step , which is not creating or modifying website ,
                but to hosting it on the world wide area i.e on the internet so each and everyone can access it.  
            </li>
        </ul>
       </p>
