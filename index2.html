              This module (CAD) includes Designing of different types of shapes specially in 2D and 3D.
              So we use softwares like Auto CAD and fusion360 and we were provided with their licinsed by FABLAB.

                <b> Fusion360</b>:- It is uesd to create 3D shapes and models.
                Fusion 360 is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE) and printed circuit board (PCB) design software application, developed by Autodesk
               .It is available for Windows, macOS and web browser, with simplified applications available for Android and iOS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>  Auto CAD</b>:- It is used to create or modify  2D shapes.
                AutoCAD is a 2D and 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software application for desktop, web, and mobile developed by Autodesk. 
                It was first released in December 1982 for the CP/M and IBM PC platforms as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here we came to know about different tools that has to be use while operating fusion360 and autocad.
             The overall experience was great while using these applications.
             We created many designs and shapes.
             Some of my works are given below, kindly check them out.
